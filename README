CmuScrobbler - Scrobble your Songs that you listened to in Cmus (python 3 version)
==================================================================================

CmuScrobbler is a little python3 script that sends your songs to last.fm,
libre.fm or any other GNUkebox server while you listen to them. It supports
"now playing", multiscrobbling (scrobbling your songs on multiple servers or
accounts) and also caches the scrobbles while you are offline to upload them
once you get online again.
