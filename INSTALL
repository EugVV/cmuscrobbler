CmuScrobbler - Installation Guide
================================

To install CmuScrobble, copy the python script somewhere convenient (e.g.
/home/user/.cmus/cmuscrobble.py).

Edit the beginning of the file and add your last.fm username and password and
set the path to the cachefile (e.g. /home/user/.cmus/cmuscrobble.cache).

Make sure you have python-scrobbler installed. You can install it with
easy_installer by entering `sudo easy_install scrobbler`.

ATTENTION! CmuScrobbler now needs a patched version of scrobbler (until my
patches get accepted upstream). Please install python-scrobbler with
`sudo easy_install http://beast.ethz.ch/~david/cmuscrobbler/scrobbler-1.0.0a2_patch-py2.5.egg`


CmuScrobbler also depends on mutagen to read the MusicBrainz TrackID from the
ID3-tags. You can install it also with easy_install, type: `sudo easy_install
mutagen`.

Afer you have done all this you can set cmus to use cmuscrobbler.py by entering
`:set status_display_program=/home/user/.cmus/cmuscrobble.py`.

Then you should be good to go to scrobble your brains out.
