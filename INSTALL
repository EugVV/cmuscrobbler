CmuScrobbler - Installation Guide
================================

To install CmuScrobble, copy the python script somewhere convenient (e.g.
/home/user/.cmus/cmuscrobble.py).

Edit the beginning of the file and add your last.fm username and password and
set the path to the cachefile (e.g. /home/user/.cmus/cmuscrobble.last.cache)
and pidfile. You can also use the config file ~/.cmuscrobbler.conf or
~/.cmus/cmuscrobbler.conf to make it easier to update the script (see CONFIG
EXAMPLE below).

You can now do multiscrobble. Just add multiple entries to the config. See the
source for an example.

Make sure you have python-scrobbler installed. You can install it with
easy_installer by entering `sudo easy_install scrobbler`.


ATTENTION! CmuScrobbler now needs a patched version of scrobbler (until my
patches get accepted upstream). Please install python-scrobbler with
`sudo easy_install https://noahduffy.me/files/scrobbler-1.0.0a2_patch-py2.7.egg`

If you want to bake your own scrobbler package you can find the patch here:
https://sourceforge.net/p/scrobbler/patches/1/


CmuScrobbler also depends on mutagen to read the MusicBrainz TrackID from the
ID3-tags. You can install it also with easy_install, type:
`sudo easy_install mutagen`

Afer you have done all this you can set cmus to use cmuscrobbler.py by entering
`:set status_display_program=/home/user/.cmus/cmuscrobbler.py`

Then you should be good to go to scrobble your brains out.
