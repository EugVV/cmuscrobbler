CmuScrobbler - Installation Guide
================================

To install CmuScrobble, copy the python script somewhere convenient (e.g.
/home/user/.cmus/cmuscrobble.py).

Edit the beginning of the file and add your last.fm username and password and
set the path to the cachefile (e.g. /home/user/.cmus/cmuscrobble.cache).

Make sure you have python-scrobbler installed. You can install it with
easy_installer by entering `sudo easy_install scrobbler`.

Afer you have done all this you can set cmus to use cmuscrobbler.py by entering
`:set status_display_program=/home/user/.cmus/cmuscrobble.py`.

Then you should be good to go to scrobble your brains out.
