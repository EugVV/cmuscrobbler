cmuscrobbler TODO
=================

Stuff to be done until next release is possible:

Make the charset configurable.

Wait for my patches to python-scrobbler to be commited.

Right now there's a little error in my implementation. It treats 'pause' like
'stop' but in the last.fm Submissions Protocol states that pausing should be
irrelevant. So we might have to store the playtime when paused and add it if
the same song gets resumed.
